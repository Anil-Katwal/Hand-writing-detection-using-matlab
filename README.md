<h1>Handwriting Detection using MATLAB Overview</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Handwriting Detection project implemented in MATLAB! This repository contains code and resources for creating a handwriting detection system using MATLAB, a powerful programming language widely used in engineering and scientific applications.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Image Preprocessing:</strong> Utilize MATLAB's image processing capabilities for enhancing and preparing handwritten images.</li>
  <li><strong>Machine Learning Model:</strong> Implement a trained model for handwriting detection using MATLAB's machine learning functionalities.</li>
  <li><strong>User-friendly Interface:</strong> Develop a simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) for users to upload images and obtain handwriting detection results.</li>
  <li><strong>Accuracy and Performance Metrics:</strong> Evaluate the model's accuracy and performance on various datasets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system. Additionally, the project may require specific toolboxes for image processing and machine learning. Check the requirements.txt or equivalent file for details.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
