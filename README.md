Handwriting Detection using MATLAB
Overview
Welcome to the Handwriting Detection project implemented in MATLAB! This repository contains code and resources for creating a handwriting detection system using MATLAB, a powerful programming language widely used in engineering and scientific applications.

Features
Image Preprocessing: Utilize MATLAB's image processing capabilities for enhancing and preparing handwritten images.
Machine Learning Model: Implement a trained model for handwriting detection using MATLAB's machine learning functionalities.
User-friendly Interface: Develop a simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) for users to upload images and obtain handwriting detection results.
Accuracy and Performance Metrics: Evaluate the model's accuracy and performance on various datasets.
Requirements
Make sure you have MATLAB installed on your system. Additionally, the project may require specific toolboxes for image processing and machine learning. Check the requirements.txt or equivalent file for details.
